This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with AsyncStorage in React Native: `getItem` returning null despite successful data storage. The issue arises from the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage; attempting to access data before it's fully retrieved leads to null values. The solution showcases proper asynchronous handling using `.then()` or `async/await` to ensure data is available before use.
